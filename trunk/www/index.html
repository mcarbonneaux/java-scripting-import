<P> Mustang (Java SE 6)  will contain a Scripting Framework based on
the Reference implementation of 
</P>
<P> <A HREF="http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=223">JSR 223:
Scripting for the JavaTM Platform</A>.</P>
<P>The Framework can be used to host Script Engines in Java
Applications.  The Mustang release includes a Script Engine based on 
</P>
<P><A HREF="http://www.mozilla.org/rhino/">Rhino: JavaScript for Java</A></P>
<P>The Framework also supports third-party Script Engines that
implement the <A HREF="http://download.java.net/jdk6/docs/api/javax/script/package-summary.html">JSR
223 Scripting APIs</A> .   The primary purpose of the  project is to
provide ScriptEngine implementations that developers can use in their
Java Applications.  Developers  can also use the Script Engines as
examples of how to implement the Scripting APIs using their own
Java-based Scripting implementations.</P>
<P>The project will also include example applications that use the
Scripting Framework.  Developers are invited to participate in the
project by including their own ScriptEngines and applications.</P>
<P>The original contents of the project include Script Engines based
on several third-party Java-based scripting implementations.  These
