<P>Java SE 6 will contain 
<A HREF="http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=223">JSR 223:
Scripting for the JavaTM Platform</A> API classes. This Framework can be used to host Script Engines in Java
Applications. Sun's implementation of Java SE 6 includes a Script Engine based on 
<A HREF="http://www.mozilla.org/rhino/">Rhino: JavaScript for Java</A></P>

<P>The Scripting Framework also supports third-party Script Engines that
implement the <A HREF="http://download.java.net/jdk6/docs/api/javax/script/package-summary.html">JSR
223 Scripting APIs</A> . The primary purpose of this project is to
provide ScriptEngine implementations that developers can use in their
Java Applications.  Developers  can also use the Script Engines as
examples of how to implement the Scripting APIs using their own
Java-based Scripting implementations.</P>
<P>This project also includes example applications that use the
Scripting Framework.  Developers are invited to participate in the
project by including their own ScriptEngines and applications.</P>
<P>The Source Code in the project is licensed under the BSD License. 
The third-party scripting implementations used by several of the
Script Engines are included in binary form for convenience.  In some
cases their licensing terms impose conditions and restrictions on
software derived from them or using them.  The text of each
third-party license is included. 
</P>

<h3>Working with the binaries</h3>

<ul>
<li>Download <b>jsr223-engines.tar.gz</b> (or <b>jsr223-engines.zip</b>) from
"Documents & files" link.
<li>gunzip/untar (or unzip) it in a directory, say $JSR223-ENGINES
<li>There is one directory for each language for which jsr223 engine is
available.
<li>Under each directory, there is a README.TXT that has URL of the
scripting language implementation. You have to download that under
the <code>lib</code> sub-directory.
<li>To try out command line usage, look for scripts under <code>bin</code>
sub-directory.
</ul>

<h3>Working with the source</h3>

<h4>Build Requirements</h4>
<ul>
<li><a href="https:/mustang.dev.java.net">JDK 6</a></li>
<li><a href="http://ant.apache.org">Ant build tool from http://ant.apache.org</a> - you need ant version 1.5.4 or above</li>
<li><a href="https://www.dev.java.net/nonav/scdocs/ddCVS.html">cvs</a> to checkout the sources for this project</li>
</ul>

<h4>Steps to build</h4>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://www.dev.java.net/scdocs/ddUsingCVS_command-line.html">CVS checkout</a> the scripting project in a directory, say $SCRIPTING_SRC
<li>To build all script engines, use the following commands:
<pre>
<code>
    cd  <b>$SCRIPTING_SRC/engines</b>
    ant
</code>
</pre>
<li>To build a specific script engine, use the following commands:
<pre>
<code>
    cd <b>$SCRIPTING_SRC/engines/&lt;script-engine-dir&gt;/make</b>
    ant
</code>
</pre>
</ol>

<h4>Steps to run/use</h4>

<ol>
<li>cd <b><code>$SCRIPTING_SRC/engines/&lt;script-engine-dir&gt;/bin</code></b>
<li>Use the shell script (or batch file) under the above dir
to run the script engine. These are wrappers over <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/tools/share/jrunscript.html">jrunscript</a> tool shipped with Mustang JDK.
</ol>

<p>
To use a specific script engine for language <i>Foo</i> in your application, 
you have put <i>Foo-</i>engine.jar file and associated jar files in $SCRIPTING_SRC/engines/<i>Foo</i>/lib/ in your CLASSPATH. In your Java class, you can get
<code><a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/javax/script/ScriptEngine.html">ScriptEngine</a></code> instance using the following snippet:
<pre>
<code>
    <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/javax/script/ScriptEngineManager.html">ScriptEngineManager</a> m = new ScriptEngineManager();
    <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/javax/script/ScriptEngine.html">ScriptEngine</a> fooEngine = m.getEngineByName("Foo");
</code>
</pre>
</p>

<h3>Scripting applications</h3>
<p>
In addition to the JSR-223 script engines for many languages, we want to
develop/maintain interesting/useful applications of scripting. To start,
scripting support modules for <b><a href="http://www.netbeans.org">NetBeans</a>
</b> IDE have been added under <b><code>applications/NetBeansModules</code></b>
directory.
</p>

<h3>Useful scripts</h3>
<p>
We want to create/maintain useful scripts in this project. To start with, 
we have added few scripts under <b><code>scripts/javascript/ajax</code></b> 
directory. 
</p>
<p>These include <b><code>ajax.js</code></b> (script
to support XMLHttpRequest, XMLSerializer, DOMParser etc. for Mustang's
JavaScript engine) and two test scripts (test.js, test2.js) to test the same.
</p>

Also, expressions [${xxx}] may be from any scripting language rather than
Jexl alone.
