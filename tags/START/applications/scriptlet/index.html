<h1>What are Scriptlets?</h1>

<p>
A Scriptlet is a Java applet written in JavaScript. Developers
use a predefined applet class (com.sun.scriptlet.Scriptlet) 
and define an applet param which identifies a JavaScript. The JavaScript
code can define one or more script functions to "override" 
applet's methods such as start, stop, init, destroy or paint.
By just defining paint function, scriptlet becomes more or less
same as the new <b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canvas_(HTML_element)">canvas tag</a></b>.
But unlike canvas tag, scriptlet functions can access the entire 
JDK API. The current applet object is exposed as first argument
to scriptlet functions. Using this, scriptlet can play audio 
(by calling play method), for example. With just the knowledge 
of JavaScript and Java API, very nice applets can be written.
No direct Java knowledge is required.

<h3>Scriptlet JavaScript "API"</h3>

<b><a href="src/resources/scriptlet.init.js">scriptlet.init.js</a></b>
is the initial script file executed by Scriptlet before actually
executing user-defined scripts. This initialization script
defines few useful functions and variables. 
Using

Java-to-Javascript Communication</a></b> between Java to 
browser's built-in JavaScript engine, a <code>window</code>
variable is defined. This <code>window</code> variable can be
used by scriptlet scripts to access browser's script objects.
For example, <code>window.location.href</code> returns the URL
of the currently visited web page. Similarly <code>window.document</code>
can be used to get the DOM document object of the current
HTML page.
